Editted 6/20/2021.

Working on changing this.  Adding Baskerville, Gotham, Bodoni, Times New Roman, Akzidenz Grotesk.

Update to use bootstrap.  What is it?

Finally got around to putting this website together. 

Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) I am told but I don't know yet what the *(#$* Jekyll really is??

My question, why spend 800 hours leaning something when it'll be replaced in a year?  That is nuts.  Learning HTML5 & CSS3 & JavaScript now.  C object oriented is the flavor, but even that isn't what it was back in the 70's at launch.  

Linux is the one where you learn more and are rewarded for it. 

With Windows, the more you learn the less INTELLIGENT you become.  Not so with Linux.

I have yet to find anything NOT STOLEN by Microsoft that was worth it's weight in donkey shit.  40 years and still looking.
